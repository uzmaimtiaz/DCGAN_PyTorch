# DCGAN for MNIST

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The goal of this project is to generate realistic handwritten digits.

## Project Description

The project implements a DCGAN, which consists of two neural networks:
- **Generator (G)**: Takes random noise as input and generates images.
- **Discriminator (D)**: Takes an image as input and predicts whether it is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by G).

The two networks are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner.

Key features:
- Uses `ConvTranspose2d` for the Generator and `Conv2d` for the Discriminator.
- Implements best practices such as specific weight initialization and LeakyReLU activations.
- Tracks training progress with loss logging and periodic image generation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- tqdm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the DCGAN model, run the following command:

```bash
python DCGAN_MNIST.py
```

### What happens during execution:
- The script initializes a unique run ID using `uuid`.
- Directories are created in `runs/{UNIQUE_RUN_ID}/` to store logs and generated images.
- The MNIST dataset is downloaded (if not present) to `MNIST_data/`.
- The training loop runs for the specified number of epochs (default is 1).
- Generated images are saved every 100 batches to `runs/{UNIQUE_RUN_ID}/generated_images/`.
- Training logs are saved to `runs/{UNIQUE_RUN_ID}/logs/training.log`.
- A final grid of generated images is saved as `final_output.png` in the images directory.

```

## Results

Output artifacts are stored in the `runs/` directory. Each run creates a unique subdirectory containing:
- `logs/training.log`: Loss values for Generator and Discriminator.
- `generated_images/`: Snapshots of generated images during training.
